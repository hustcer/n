## Publish Nushell to the NPM repository

The only purpose of this repository is to publish [Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) officially released binaries to the `NPM` registry as is, for easy installation via `npm`.

For issues about the `nushell` **npm** package (such as installation, format, etc.) please create an issue [here](https://github.com/hustcer/nu-to-npm/issues), and for issues about the `nu` binaries please go to the [Official Nushell Repo](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues) to submit an issue.

## Note

The **npm** package for `nushell` currently contains only the `nu` binary, and the official plugins were not included, if you need the full version, please build it from source or [download the packages from here](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases)
